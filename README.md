## Global dependencies

Make sure you have NodeJS installed. Download the installer [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/) or use your favorite package manager. It's best to get the 8x version of node along with the 5x version of npm. This offers the best in stability and speed for building.

```
node -v
> v8.6.0
npm -v
> 5.4.2
```

```
npm install -g ionic@2.2.2
npm install -g cordova@6.4.0
```

For building iOS projects you have to install **Xcode** and **Ruby** for installing the following gem:

```
gem install xcodeproj
```

Install **ios-deploy** to deploy iOS applications to devices.

```
sudo npm install -g ios-deploy --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

## Local dependencies

All the project dependencies are manage through [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/). To install this dependencies you should run:

```

ionic emulate [ios|android]
```

If you want to **test the application on real devices** or the browser emulator you could connect a real device in your computer and run:
